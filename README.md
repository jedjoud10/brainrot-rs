Fuck you mean I can't brain rot in peace?

* 3 registers
* Simple IO (chat)
* Graphics capable
* Multithreadable or Parallelizable
* Weird operations
* Conditionals, loops
* Vector additions and vector math
* Output 480x480 bitmask

```
REGISTERS
2 registers that can swap types. either float or integer
let __a__ be __b__ __c__
__a__: me/you
__b__: inting/fr
__c__: rn,bruh,
let you be inting bruh
let me be fr rn
fr = float
inting = integer
```

```
TYPE CONDITIONALS
is __a__ __b__?:
__a__: me/you
__b__: inting/fr
Goes to last "nuhuh"/"ofcbruh" gotos
```

```
COMPARISON CONDITIONALS
is __a__ mogging '__a__?
__a__: me/you
Goes to last "nuhuh"/"ofcbruh" gotos
```

```
MATH:
lemme rizz you __a__
__a__: up/down
Adds or subtracts 1 to the you register.
```

```
IO
output:
__a__ in the chat
__a__: ws/ls
Prints result of last successful operation or of last failed operation (ws=success, ls=fail)

input: 
chat, is this real?
saves input value to all real regs

chat, is this inting?
saves input value to all int regs
